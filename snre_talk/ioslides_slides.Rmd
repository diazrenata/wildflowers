# Macroecology and community ecology

## 

A macroecological approach to **community ecology**

- How (and why) are _abundance_, _biomass_, and _resource use_ distributed among species in ecological communities?
- How (and why) does this change over time?
- How (and why) do species' dynamics combine to produce community-level phenomena?

## 

A **macroecological approach** to community ecology

- "Community ecology is a mess"...
- ...but may contain "fuzzy generalities"



## 

A macroecological approach to community ecology

- is grounded in **ecology**: 
    - natural history
    - experiments
    - classic concepts

## 

A macroecological approach to community ecology


- is grounded in **ecology**: 
    - natural history
    - experiments
    - classic concepts
- draws on **complex systems science**:
    - data-intensive synthesis
    - focus on emergent phenomena
    - methods and concepts transcend disciplines
