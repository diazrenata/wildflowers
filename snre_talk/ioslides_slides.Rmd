# Macroecology and community ecology

## 

A macroecological approach to **community ecology**

- How (and why) are _abundance_, _biomass_, and _resource use_ distributed among species in ecological communities?
- How (and why) does this change over time?
- How (and why) do species' dynamics combine to produce community-level phenomena?

## 

A **macroecological approach** to community ecology

- "Community ecology is a mess"...
- ...but may contain "fuzzy generalities"



## 

A macroecological approach to community ecology

- is grounded in **ecology**: 
    - natural history
    - experiments
    - classic concepts

## 

A macroecological approach to community ecology


- is grounded in **ecology**: 
    - natural history
    - experiments
    - classic concepts
- draws on **complex systems science**:
    - data-intensive synthesis
    - focus on emergent phenomena
    - methods and concepts transcend disciplines


## 

A macroecological approach to community ecology


- Focus on **community-level properties**
    - Total **abundance**, **biomass**, **energy use**
- **Distributions** among species and organisms 

<!-- here you will want to illustrate SADs and ISDs, at least. but also not sure if this slide even belongs here --> 



## Of rodents and randomness

**I. How do community-level properties respond to species loss?**

A long-term experimental perspective

**II. How do changes in community structure modulate long-term trends in biodiversity?**

A continental-scale synthesis

**III. What can ubiquitous mathematical constraints on complex systems reveal about "laws" in community ecology?**

A cross-disciplinary synthesis

# I. Impacts of species loss on community function in a changing world

## Community function

Total **energy use** or **biomass**

## Species loss directly impacts function

## Compensation can offset declines in function due to species loss

## Compensation linked to functional redundancy

## Functional redundancy may change over time

**Metacommunity** dynamics

Changes in the dynamics between the **same set of species**

**Impacts of species loss on community function may therefore be temporally variable and context dependent**
