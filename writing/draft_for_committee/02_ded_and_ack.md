# Acknowledgements

I will always be grateful to my dissertation advisor, Morgan Ernest, and my committee, Ethan White, Jamie Gillooly, and Justin Kitzes, for five years' of support and guidance as I have found my way through these projects. Throughout this journey, my mentors have consistently given me the encouragement and freedom to pursue challenging and adventurous projects, and modeled an approach to science grounded in curiosity, kindness, and bravery. I hope to bring a similar spirit to my future endeavors.

I am equally grateful to the ones who have shared this path with me over the years. In particular: Hao Ye, for being a steady and wise teacher on topics ranging from computational ecology, to cycling, to combinatorics; Ellen Bledsoe, for being a role model and a friend, from my very first weeks as a weecologist; Sam Zlotnik, for sharing an appreciation for creatures; and Pat Dumandan for bringing joy and fresh perspective to the lab. And, lastly, Jerald Pinson, for boundless curiousity, mirth, and patience. 

Fundamentally, this dissertation is for my family. My mother, Katie, is a scientist in the purest way, and perpetually inspires me to find something new to wonder about in the natural world. My father, Ricardo, taught me that no matter how abstract or sophisticated a theory may seem, on some level it is about rats; and that sometimes a bicycle holds more answers than a supercomputer. My sister, Rosalind, brings wisdom and lightness to every challenge, and I am grateful every day that there are two of us. Finally, Hatter never forgets to remind me to love the little things in life, and gives me a reason to come home even on the darkest nights.
