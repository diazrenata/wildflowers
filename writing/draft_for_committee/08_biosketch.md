# Biosketch

Renata Diaz grew up surrounded by the fields of eastern Colorado and the forests of New England, in a family of enthusiastic puzzle solvers and natural historians. During her undergraduate work in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University, she developed a keen interest in the interplay between theoretical, computational, and empirical modalities in ecology. For her senior thesis, she combined field experiments with a mathematical model to predict how the joint effects of large mammalian herbivores, small mammalian seed predators, and historical legacies of human-wildlife interactions modulate the spatial distribution of trees in East African savannas. From 2015 to 2017, she continued to explore dimensions of ecology as a research assistant in the Staver Lab at Yale University (2015-2016), a field intern with the Ecology of Bird Loss Project (2016), and a spatial data analysis intern at the Missouri Botanic Garden (2017). In 2017, she joined the Ernest lab at the University of Florida to pursue a PhD in macroecology, combining field work associated with the Portal Project with data- and computationally- intensive synthesis, software development projects, and intellectually adventurous theoretical pursuits.
