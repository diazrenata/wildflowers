# Biosketch

\rho grew up surrounded by the fields of eastern Colorado and the forests of New England, in a family of enthusiastic puzzle solvers and natural historians. During her undergraduate work at Princeton University (class of 2015), she developed a keen interest in the interplay between theoretical, computational, and empirical modalities in ecology. From 2015 to 2017, she explored field, greenhouse, theoretical, and computational dimensions of ecology as a research assistant in the Staver Lab at Yale University (2015-2016), a field intern with the Ecology of Bird Loss Project (2016), and a spatial data analysis intern at the Missouri Botanic Garden (2017). In 2017, she joined the Ernest lab at the University of Florida to pursue a PhD in macroecology, combining field work with the Portal Project with data- and computationally- intensive synthesis and intellectually adventurous theoretical pursuits.
