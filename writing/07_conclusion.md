# Chapter 5: Concluding remarks


This dissertation traverses the scope of a macroecological lens on community structure and dynamics, across three distinct organizational and spatial scales and contrasting methods of scientific inquiry. Chapter 2 focuses on the link between species interactions and community properties in a single system, using a long-running manipulative experiments to disentangle nuanced dynamics of compensation and competition. Chapter 3 uses modern advances in computational infrastructure and data-intensive ecology to perform an observational, data-driven synthesis of long-term biodiversity dynamics for communities across the continent of North America. Finally, chapter 4 steps beyond the traditional scope of ecology to apply theoretical approaches derived from statistical mechanics to understand the significance of ecological "laws", using data from communities across the globe and tree of life. 

Separately, each of these vignettes illustrates the value, and the limitations, of these distinct approaches and scales of inquiry in community ecology. 

Combined, ...
